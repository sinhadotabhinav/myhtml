<!-- CONTENT -->
<P>Linking in HTML code is done with the anchor tag, the &lt;A&gt; tag. The letter 
&quot;A&quot; in the tag is then followed by an attribute. For a link to another 
web page, the &quot;A&quot; is followed by &quot;HREF&quot;. To set a bookmark 
in the same page, the &quot;A&quot; is followed by &quot;NAME&quot;, which you'll 
see how to do later.</P>
<P>Take a look at this example, which is a link to the popular search engine Google:</P>
<p class="TextAlignment"><b>&lt;A HREF = &quot;http://www.google.com/&quot;&gt;</b>Google 
Search Engine<b>&lt;/A&gt;</b></p>
<p>Notice where all the angle brackets (&lt; &gt;) are in the link. After the 
first one, we have the &quot;A&quot; part of the tag. Then we have the HREF 
part, signifying a link to another web page. After that comes an equals sign 
(=). After the equals sign comes the address of the web page itself. The address 
is case sensitive, so if there is a capital letter in the address, make sure 
to include it. This address <b>www.google.com</b> is different from this address 
<b>www.gOOgle.com</b>.</p>
<p>After the address comes the right angle bracket ( &gt; ). Next comes the text 
that people see, the text you want them to click on. To close an anchor link, 
you use the end anchor tag. Which is this: <b>&lt;/A&gt;</b></p>
<p>But let's get some practical work done. </p>
<p>Open up your template text file. Click <b>File &gt; Save As</b> from the menu 
in Notepad (or whatever text editor you are using). When the Save As dialogue 
box appears navigate to your HTML folder:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter4/html_folder.gif" alt="Web site folder structure"></P>
<P>So we are going to save the new web page outside of the pages folder.</P>
<p>In the file name box, type <b>index.html.</b> Make sure the <b>Save As Type</b> 
area says All Files, if you use Windows. Before you click the <b>Save</b> button 
your Explorer window should look like this:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter4/save_as_DB.gif" alt="Creating an index.html page"></P>
<P>When the Save button is clicked, you should then have a web page called index.html 
in the HTML folder:</P>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter4/explorer_folders.gif" alt="Creating an index.html page"></P>
<P>What we're going to do is to place a hyperlink on our <b>index</b> page. When 
this hyperlink is clicked we'll tell the browser to load a page called <b>about.html</b>. 
We'll save this new <b>about</b> page in our pages folder.</P>
<p>So, use your template text file to create a new web page. When you save the 
page, double click the pages folder to move inside it. In the file name box, 
type <b>about.html</b>. Then save your page:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter4/about_page_DB.gif" alt="Creating an about us web page"></P>
<p>So, we have a web page in the HTML folder and a web page in the pages folder. 
We now need to link them together.</p>
<p>Open up you code for the index.html page. Insert the following line between 
the two BODY tags:</p>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">&lt;A HREF=&quot;pages/about.html&quot;&gt;About 
this site&lt;/A&gt;</p>
<p> Your code should look like this (we've added a TITLE):</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter4/code_index_link.gif" alt="HTML code to create a hyperlink"></P>
<p>Save your work and load the page in your browser. You should see this:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter4/page_index_link.gif" alt="A HTML hyperlink on the index page"></P>
<p>And that's a hyperlink! Notice that the only thing on the page viewable to 
the visitor is the text &quot;About this site&quot;. The code we wrote turns 
it from normal text into a link that people can click on. The code itself was 
this:</p>
<p class="TextAlignment"><b>&lt;A HREF=&quot;pages/about.html&quot;&gt;</b>About 
this site<b>&lt;/A&gt;</b></p>
<p>So to turn text into a link you start with an angle bracket followed by the 
letter A. After a space, type HREF. An equal sign comes next. The page you want 
to link to goes between quotation marks. But notice we started with the folder 
name: <b>pages/about.html.</b> This says, &quot;Look for a page called <b>about.html.</b> 
This page is in the pages folder&quot;.</p>
<p>Type a right-pointing angle bracket to end the first part of the link code. 
The text you want people to see comes next &quot;About this site&quot;. To wrap 
it all up, you need the closing hyperlinks tag : &lt;/A&gt;.</p>
<p>When you click your link, you should find a blank page loads in the browser. 
If you look at the address bar, you should see it says <b>about.html</b> on 
the end. You have successfully linked to a new page!</p>
<p>To get back to the index page, you need another link. </p>
<p>Open up your code for the about.html page. For the <b>about</b> page, we need 
to construct the correct HREF. We can't do this:</p>
<p class="TextAlignment"><b>&lt;A HREF=&quot;pages/index.html&quot;&gt;</b>Go 
to the Home Page<b>&lt;/A&gt;</b></p>
<p>The above HREF is pointing to an index page in the pages folder. But our index 
page is not in this folder. It is in the HTML folder, which is one folder up 
from pages. Just like we did for images, we can use two dots and a forward slash:</p>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">&lt;A HREF=&quot;https://www.homeandlearn.co.uk/index.html&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>Two dots and a forward slash, remember, mean &quot;Go up one folder&quot;.</p>
<p>So insert the following code in your <b>about.html </b>page:</p>
<p class="TextAlignment"><b>&lt;A HREF=&quot;https://www.homeandlearn.co.uk/index.html&quot;&gt;</b>Go to 
the Home Page<b>&lt;/A&gt;</b></p>
<p>Save your work and refresh the page in your browser. Click your hyperlink on 
the about.html page. You should find that the index page will load. When you 
click the link on the index page, the about page will load.</p>
<p><b>Exercise</b><br>
Create a third web page. Save it in your pages folder and call it <b>contact.html</b>. 
Create a link from the <b>index</b> page to this new page. Create a link back 
from the <b>contact</b> page to the <b>index</b> page.</p>
<p><br>
When you complete the above exercise, you will have two links on the index page. 
They might look like this:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter4/index_page_links.gif" alt="Two HTML hyperlinks on the index page"></P>
<p>You can use the HTML techniques you've learned so far to improve the look of 
these links. For example, you may want the links going vertically instead of 
horizontally. In which case, surround you hyperlinks code with P tags. Here's 
the code for two vertical links on the index page:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter4/links_vertical.gif" alt="Vertical HTML hyperlinks"></P>
<p>The result would look like this:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment"><img src="images/chapter4/two_links_ex_2.gif" alt="Vertical HTML hyperlinks in Internet Explorer"></P>
<p>However, don't worry too much about the presentation for now as you'll see 
how to improve navigation links with CSS and HTML Lists a little later. But 
try this exercise.</p>
<p><br>
<b>Exercise</b><br>
Have two links on each of your three pages. The about.html page should have 
links that lead to the index page and the contact page. The conact.html page 
should have links to the index page and the about page.</p>
<p>The tricky part about the exercise above is getting the HREF part right. Just 
remember that when the html pages are in the same folder you only need to type 
the name of the page you're linking to. So this:</p>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">HREF=&quot;page_name_here.html&quot;</p>
<p>instead of this:</p>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">HREF=&quot;../page_name_here.html&quot;</p>
<p>or this:</p>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">HREF=&quot;pages/page_name_here.html&quot;</p>
<p>You're just using the same file referencing rules that you learned in the images 
section.</p>
<h3>The Target Attribute</h3>
<p>Just like the IMG tag, the A HREF tag can take attributes. One of these is 
called TARGET. The TARGET attribute is used to tell the browser where you want 
to open the link. For example, you can tell the browser to open the linked page 
in a new browser window. There are several values to choose from:</p>
<p class="TextAlignmentBold">_blank<br>
_parent<br>
_self<br>
_top<br>
</p>
<p>However, the only really useful one in HTML version 5 is BLANK. The default 
is SELF, so you don't need to specify a TARGET attribute most of the time. If 
you want the link to open up in a new window, the code is this:</p>
<P class="TextAlignment">&lt;A HREF=&quot;pages/about.html&quot; <b>TARGET=&quot;_blank&quot;</b>&gt;About 
this site<b>&lt;/A&gt;</b></P>
<P>Notice the underscore character before the word &quot;blank&quot;. Miss this 
out and your TARGET attribute won't work.</P>
<p>The other two TARGET attributes are for when your website uses something called 
FRAMES. Frames are going out of use, though, and are not recommended for HTML5.</p>
<h3>Hyperlink Colours</h3>
<P>You can set up your own colours for hyperlinks. The default is whatever the 
user has set in the browser, usually blue, with a blue underline. But you don't 
have to have blue. The A tag comes with three attributes that can help you to 
override the browser default:</P>
<P class="indent_small"><b>LINK</b><BR>
Set the colour of a link before it has been clicked on </P>
<P class="indent_small"><b>ALINK</b><BR>
Set the colour of a link when the link is clicked on </P>
<P class="indent_small"><b>VLINK</b><BR>
Set the colour of a link after it has been clicked on </P>
<P>The A and the V above stand for Active and Visited. You use them like this:</P>
<P class="TextAlignment">&lt;A HREF=&quot;pages/about.html&quot; <b>LINK=&quot;red&quot;</b>&gt;About 
this site&lt;/A&gt;</P>
<P>So you select the attribute you want to use, and then choose a colour for your 
links. This can also be a hexadecimal or RGB value.</P>
<p>Try them out for yourself with the links in any of your three web pages. Bear 
in mind, though, that people expect a hyperlink to be blue with an underline 
- it's a visual clue that you're linking to some extra content. Also, link colours 
used this way are now out of fashion. It's better to use CSS styles for your 
hyperlinks. You'll see how to do this in a later lesson.</p>
<P>In the next lesson, you'll learn about other types of hyperlinks. </P>
